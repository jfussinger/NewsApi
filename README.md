### Overview

In the Capstone project, you will build an app of your own design in two stages. In Stage 1, you will design and plan the app, using a template that we provide in the "Instructions" node.

### Project Rubric

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to this rubric. (https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1883/view)

### Why this Project?
To become a proficient Android Developer, you need to design apps and make plans for how to implement them. This will involve choices such as how you will store data, how you will display data to the user, and what functionality to include in the app.

### What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you'll demonstrate the ability to communicate an app idea formally, using:

An app description
UI flow mocks, similar to what you've seen in other Nanodegree projects, like the Popular Movies overview
A list of required tasks that you will complete to build the app, in order
The Capstone project will give you the experience you need to own the full development of an app. This first stage replicates the design and planning experience that proficient Android Developers are expected to demonstrate.
